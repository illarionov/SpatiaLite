=====================================================================

1 - Installation:
=================

The default destination path prefix for installed files is /usr/local.
Results from the installation script will be placed into subdirectories
include and lib.  If this default path prefix is proper, then execute:

    ./configure

If another path prefix is required, then execute:

    ./configure --prefix=/my/path

In either case, the directory of the prefix path must exist and be
writable by the installer.

After executing configure, execute:

    make
    make install

Or even better, you can *strip* any executable binary, in order
to eliminate any debugging symbol, and thus widely reducing
their size:

    make install-strip

2- Required dependencies:
=========================
    
The main external dependencies needed in order to build 'libspatialite' 
are the SQLITE3, PROJ.4 and GEOS devel-packages.

ICONV [Windows]
---------------
If building on Windows, then a further dependency has to be satisfied,
the ICONV one.
PLEASE NOTE: this one is not an issue when building on Linux or MacOsX,
because these systems offers a "native" ICONV support (this latter being
a standard system component).
For Windows the preferred solution is to download and install the pre-built 
ICONV binaries and related files from:
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libiconv.htm

3 - Build notes
===============

3.1: Building on Linux
----------------------

Building 'libspatialite' on Linux does not require any special 
setting; we'll suppose you have unpacked the sources as 
./libspatialite-2.4.0

# cd libspatialite-2.4.0
# ./configure
# make
# sudo make install
#     or (in order to save some disk space)
# sudo make install-strip

3.2: Building on MacOsX
-----------------------

Building 'libspatialite' on MacOsX is quite the same as for Linux.
You simply have to set explicitly some ENV variable.
We'll suppose you have unpacked the sources as 
./libspatialite-2.4.0

# cd libspatialite-2.4.0
# export "CFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include"
# export "LDFLAGS=-I/opt/local/lib"
# ./configure 
# make
# sudo make install
#     or (in order to save some disk space)
# sudo make install-strip

IMPORTANT NOTICE: this will build an executable for your
specific platform. i.e. when building on a PPC Mac,
resulting binary will be targeted to run on PPC anyway.
And when building on Intel Mac, resulting binary will
run on Intel target.

3.3: building on Windows
------------------------

On Windows systems you can choose using two different compilers:
- MinGW / MSYS
  this represents a smart porting of a minimalistic Linux-like
  devel-toolkit
- Microsoft Visual Studio .NET
  this one is the standard platform devel-toolkit

3.3.1: using MinGW / MSYS
-------------------------

We suppose you have already installed the MinGW compiler and the MSYS shell.
Building 'libspatialite' under Windows is then more or less like building
on any other UNIX-like system. We'll suppose you have unpacked the sources as 
C:\libspatialite-2.4.0

$ cd c:/libspatialite-2.4.0
$ export "CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include"
$ export "LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib"
$ ./configure --target=mingw32
$ make
$ make install-strip
$     or (in order to save some disk space)
$ make install-strip


3.3.2: using Microsoft Visual Studio .NET
-----------------------------------------

We suppose you have already installed Visual Studio enabling the command
line tools [you are expected to use the command prompt shell].
We'll suppose you have unpacked the sources as 
C:\libspatialite-2.4.0

> cd c:\libspatialite-2.4.0
> nmake /f makefile.vc
> nmake /f makefile.vc install

Please note: standard definitions in 'makefile.vc' assumes:
- enabling PROJ
- disabling GEOS

If you want to alter this 'basic' behaviour you have then to
adapt 'makefile.vc'.
The 'libspatialite-geos.def' file contains any external symbol
to be exported from the DLL when you build including GEOS.
